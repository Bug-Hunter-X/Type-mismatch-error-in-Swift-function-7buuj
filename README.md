# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift and how to resolve it.

The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to pass a String value to a function expecting a Double. This will result in a compile-time error.

The `bugSolution.swift` file demonstrates a corrected version of the code, where type conversion is used to handle the String value before passing it to the function.
